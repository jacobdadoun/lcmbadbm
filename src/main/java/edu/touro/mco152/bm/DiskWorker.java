/**
 * Run the disk benchmarking as a Swing-compliant thread (only one of these threads can run at

 * information, which is also recorded as needed to the the observers, persistence store, and log.
 * <p>
 * Depends on static values that describe the benchmark to be done having been set in App and Gui classes.
 * The DiskRun class is used to keep track of and persist info about each benchmark at a higher level (a run),
 * while the DiskMark class described each iteration's result, which is displayed by the UI as the benchmark run
 * progresses.
 * <p>
 * This class only knows how to execute 'read' or 'write' disk benchmarks via the CommandExecutor class. It is
 * instantiated in the startBenchmark() method.
 * <p>
 * Instead of SwingWorker being dependent on DiskWorker (a class with an entirely different responsibility),
 * DiskWorker is now dependent on SwingWorker via a UserInterface type passed in to this classes constructor.
